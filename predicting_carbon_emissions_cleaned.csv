With the transition to deregulated electricity tariffs (NOME Act, New Organization of the Electricity Market), Gecina has incorporated into its contracts a clause stipulating that a portion of its power supply must come from french renewable energy. Currently, this electricity is exclusively from hydraulic production, emitting 6 gCO2/kWh while the electricity without guarantee of origin emits 6 to 30 times more emission Use energy supply methods that limit direct emissions (scope 1), or indirect emissions (scope 2), by undertaking work to improve the facilities of the buildings in operation. Dedicated budgets are allocated in order to implement lower GHG emitting eco-variants for each technical installation to be replaced. For example, fuel oil boilers are replaced by other systems (networks, natural gas) for greater energy efficiency and a lower carbon footprint (this criterion takes precedence over the first). As a result, connection to urban networks that emit lower levels of greenhouse gases, for example the Paris CPCU network (175 gCO2/kWh) or the Idex network, in Boulogne-Billancourt (103 gCO2/kWh) are favored over natural gas solutions (300 gCO2/kWh) or electric solutions (180 gCO2/kWh). Likewise, the use of urban cooling networks, like the Climespace network (40 gCO2/kWh), substantially improves the footprint of the properties compared to an electrical solution.",23.21,Market-based,91,164,75,94,37,81,43,56,71,67,68,69,68,114,122,97,109,97,79,121,46,82,46,94,53,34,74,52,82,59,60,0.05,0.13,0.12,0.17,0.19,0.06,fr0010040865,0.015006252,0.010226662,0.011763147,0.012511301,0.526566416,23.20524638,8210.0,11109.0,19319.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The allocation of GHG emissions is completed through using emission factors applied to each unit of energy consumption. The two methods are the location-based method which indicates the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs, while the other is the market-based method which reflects emissions from electricity provided by utility companies. The former uses grid average emission factors while the latter uses supplier-specific emission factors in order to define scope 2 emissions.These two methods together make up the Dual Reporting structure for scope 2 that has become the industry standard for corporations when they report scope 2 emissions. Historically, CRH used only one single emission factor for all types of electricity (purchased non-renewable, purchased renewable and onsite generated renewable) Starting 2016, CRH also follows the Dual Reporting structure of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, but since the company does not centrally collect product or supplier-specific data from its 3,800 operating locations, it uses only location-based method (U.S. data is on state-based factors given by eGRID while the rest of the world is on the International Energy Agency’s grid factors) in order to calculate scope 2 emissions in 2016.",906.68,Location-based,165,78,40,108,83,91,75,77,95,56,113,81,81,106,98,55,100,55,100,53,106,0,37,78,43,73,30,224,50,48,111,0.13,0.3,0.18,0.19,0.09,0.27,ie0001827041,0.019671169,0.012589726,0.015572681000000001,0.014162048,0.461403509,906.6787558,24700000.0,2500000.0,27200000.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Japanese records are calculated based on the “Law Concerning the Rational Use of Energy,” and the CO2 emissions factor for calculating purchased electricity is the actual value for each electric power provider in each fiscal year. The CO2 emissions factor for calculating electricity purchased outside Japan is acquired from each electric supplier.In the third party verification which is attached in CC8.6a and CC8.7a, their limited assurance engagement about Scope 2 is ""246 thousand t-CO2"", which seems a little different from CC8.3a. The difference arise from rounding error.

Our provider guarantees that 100% of the electricity it supplies to EY's offices in Edinburgh, 1 More London Place (London), Becket House (London), Luton, Manchester and Reading is generated from renewable sources. It has purchased this energy from renewable generators and allocated an equivalent number of Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) or Guarantee of Origin (GoO) certificates to EY. REGO / GoO certificates are recognised by Ofgem to demonstrate that electricity has been produced from renewable sources within a defined period.EY also purchases all UK non half-hourly (NHH) electricity via a green tariff.  However, because we do not currently hold the evidence needed to include this in our zero emissions-rated consumption, we have calculated relevant emissions using the appropriate residual mix conversion factor.  We hope to be able to obtain the evidence required in the future to enable us to include this energy consumption under that which is zero emissions-rated.",2.06,Market-based,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.32,0.25,0.28,0.31,0.32,,,,,,0.0,2.056124895,1597.72,10270.7,11868.42,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A little over 50 percent of our combined manufacturing and distribution GHG footprint is from indirect electricity use at our manufacturing plants, distribution centers and corporate office buildings. Our GHG calculations consider both the amount of electricity drawn as well as the source of that electricity (coal, gas or other types of power plant fuels). Regional electric power emission factors (eGRID data) were used to compute indirect emissions. This conforms to the U.S. EPA Protocol and is consistent with the location-based method of the GHG Protocol. The location-based method is used for our 2011 baseline, goal setting and progress reporting. We also continued efforts in 2016 to collect Scope 2 emissions in the U.S. using the market-based method as stipulated by the GHG Protocol; however, we were unable to obtain any contractual instruments or supplier specific emission rates, and residual mix factors were not available for the markets in which Clorox operates.

Furthermore, SCS Global Services can provide limited assurance, based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, that no matters have come to the attention of the audit team to cause the verification body to believe that Owens Corning’s reported Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 were materially misstated.SCS applies the International Standard ISO 14065:2013 - Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.In accordance with the requirements of ISAE 3000, SCS has complied with the commercial independence and other ethical requirements of the International Standard ISO 14065:2013 - Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition, which is founded on fundamental principles of impartiality, competence, objective decision making, openness, and confidentiality.",695.44,Market-based,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.32,0.25,0.28,0.31,0.32,us6907421019,0.015198618999999998,0.012243163999999999,0.020293436,0.020019132,0.224310777,695.4405496,2559224.0,1398725.0,3957949.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
